# Password Generator Starter Code

# Description
    I am going to create a password generator that will make a password that is between 8 and 128 characters in length. In this password, there is the option given to the user to include the following: letters (both uppercase and lowercase), numbers, and special characters exculding single and double quotation marks. These options will be presented in the form of confirm boxes.

    The legnth of the password will not be in a confirm box, but will still be prompted to the user. Once I have the length of the password, I will set up sort of a checklist that will run through possible options and form a password out of the criteria needed for the password. I have set the default password length to the minimum size listed in the requirements and made sure that the password cannot be smaller. I have also made sure that the password cannot be larger than the requirement.

    I have set up a function containing a series of if statements, a for loop and a while loop to generate a random letter, number, or special character, one-by-one, until the password meets the user specified legnth criteria.
