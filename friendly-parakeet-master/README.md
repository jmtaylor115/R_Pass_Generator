# Password Generator Starter Code

# Description
    I am going to create a password generator that will make a password that is between 8 and 128 characters in length. In this password, there is the option given to the user to include the following: letters (both uppercase and lowercase), numbers, and special characters exculding single and double quotation marks. These options will be presented in the form of confirm boxes.
